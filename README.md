## AppDotNet

Development of the AppDotNet library has been discontinued. Many thanks to those who [contributed](https://github.com/mattrubin/AppDotNet/graphs/contributors).

If you are looking for a well-maintained Objective-C library for the App.net API, you should definitely check out [**ADNKit**](https://github.com/joeldev/adnkit). It is a popular and up-to-date project used by many apps, including the official App.net app for iOS.
